**Topics:**

- What is a single page application?
- What is Node.js?
- What is NPM, NPX, and NVM?

**Content:**
Single Page Applications (SPAs) are web applications that interact with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server. This approach avoids interruption of the user experience between successive pages.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, enabling server-side scripting with JavaScript.

NPM (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js, NPX is a package runner tool that comes with NPM, and NVM (Node Version Manager) allows you to manage multiple Node.js versions.

**Questions:**

1. Explain the concept of a single page application.
2. What is Node.js and why is it important for React development?
3. Describe the roles of NPM, NPX, and NVM in Node.js.
4. How does Node.js improve the performance of web applications?
